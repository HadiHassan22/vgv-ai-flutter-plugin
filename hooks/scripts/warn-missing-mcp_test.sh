#
# The hook takes no input. It prints a warning to stdout when the Very Good CLI is
# missing, outdated, or present but unable to run, and prints nothing when the CLI is
# current. It always exits 0. Every case runs against a stubbed very_good on a PATH that
# contains nothing else, so results do not depend on what is installed on the machine.
